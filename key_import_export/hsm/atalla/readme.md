# TR-34 Exchange between Atalla -> AWS Payment Cryptography (APC)
This script will exchange the Key Exchange Key (KEK) from Atalla into APC, thus bootstrapping it for migration of working keys from Atalla to APC.

## Assumptions
1. This script assumes that you have access to an Atalla HSM and can perform administrative commands such as 12A
2. The Atalla HSM is configured using a TDES MFK.  Slight changes might be needed if you are using an AES MFK
3. Keys to be transferred are 2-key or 3-key TDES.
4. The HSM is enabled for the following commands: 12A,120,136,139 for initial exchange and then 11A and option E2 to migrate working keys using TR-31.
5. You have access to AWS Private CA or access to another CA of your chosing to sign a CSR.


## Prerequisites

 1. Call [GetParametersForImport](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_GetParametersForImport.html). Save the output under [keys/params_for_import.json](./keys/params_for_import.json)
 2. Import the KRD (in this case is APC) Leaf certificate [WrappingKeyCertificate] from [params_for_import.json](./keys/params_for_import.json).json into Atalla.
 **_NOTE:_** Typically you would import the CA certificate and then root certificate.  However, the command for importing chained certificates (123) does not support the SHA-512 hash used by the APC service, so you must directly trust the leaf cert using 12A instead which is a manual process requiring dual control.

      Steps - 
      1. Get the modulus of the public key cert. Example - ```echo "LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZJQ..." | base64 -d | openssl x509 -modulus -noout```
      2. Trust KRD public key on Atalla.
      In order to establish trust, use command 12A. This is a 2 step command that requires dual control with the final output being an AKB of the public key.
         - Step 1 - ```<12A#1kREE000#010001#modulus##>``` which returns a security challenge. The 12A command needs to be rerun after the security challenge is completed via admin screen on Atalla. 
         - Step 2 -  
            ```<12A#1kREE000#010001#modulus#security channelge answer#>```. The output of the second command gives the public key akb and will look something like ```<22A#OK#1kREE000,00030100010100B0357EB48EEEEAE......#>```
         - Save output from the header onwards to the end of the response (```1kREE000,00030.....BBB,26A8A315```) on to the [krd_public_key_akb file](./keys/tr34_offline_krd_public_key_akb).

 ## Script Usage
 ```
 1. python -m venv .venv
 2. source .venv/bin/activate 
 3. pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 4. python3 atalla_to_apc_tr34.py <hsm address> <hsm port> 
    Example: python3 atalla_to_apc_tr34.py '127.0.0.1' 7000 
 ```

## The script does the following - 
1. Generate Signing Key on Atalla (command 120)
2. Generate CSR within this sample code and then sign on the Atalla (command 139). Update the CSR subject information in file `atalla_to_apc_tr34.py` if desired.
 **_NOTE:_** although command 124 is typically used for digital signatures, it cannot be used when the purpose of the key will be to sign TR-34 payloads.
3. Have CSR signed by CA of your choice ([AWS Private Certificate Authority](https://aws.amazon.com/private-ca/) is used here)
4. Trust Signing CA on APC - Use APC.[Import Public Root KeyCertificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_ImportKey.html)
5. Build TR-34 payload and generate KEK (136).  Save Atalla KEK for future use.
6. Sign TR-34 payload (139)
7. Build combined payload using the TR-34 non-CMS payload structure  (code sample - not cryptographic)
8. Import key into APC by calling [ImportKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_ImportKey.html)

### After running the script and having KEK exchanged, here are the steps to transfer working keys - 
1. Use TR-31 to export keys using KEK generated in step #5 (command 11A)
   - Example 
      - Request ```<11A#B###1kDNE000,542DEAC009433454AAAAAABBBBBBCCCCC93453FFFFFFFFFD,455BBBBAAAACCCCC#1CDNE000,FFFFAAA98923423423CCCCCEE34545655BBBAAAFFFF45354,93245FFAADDDCCAA#00#0##>```
      where, field 4 is the KEK generated from step 5 above and field 5 is the AKB of the working key to export.

      - Response ```<21A#BBAA4453FDDCC089AB8C50BB184BBA7499EA610346321F5952C602204AE6C4FFF89F547A2E51E9456456DDDAACCCC556#1786#>```
      where field 1 is the TR-31 block and field 2 is the check digits that should match with the key check value from the APC after import. 
2. Call Import key on APC passing TR-31 block from previous step
   - ```
      aws payment-cryptography import-key \
            --key-material="Tr31KeyBlock={WrappingKeyIdentifier="arn:aws:payment-cryptography:us-west-2:017213218332:key/b4423463aaagnr",\
           WrappedKeyBlock="BBAA4453FDDCC089AB8C50BB184BBA7499EA610346321F5952C602204AE6C4FFF89F547A2E51E9456456DDDAACCCC556"}" --region us-west-2
      ```
 **_NOTE:_** Unless otherwise enabled, option E2 on Atalla may restrict your ability to output certain keys (including other KEK)s. This is a common source of error 0607 (security violation)
